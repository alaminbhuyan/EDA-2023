EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. The primary goal of EDA is to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the data, as well as to identify any outliers or anomalies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves the examination and visualization of data to gain insights and understand its underlying structure. EDA aims to reveal patterns, trends, and potential outliers within the dataset, aiding in the formulation of hypotheses and guiding subsequent analysis.

Key aspects of EDA include:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Utilizing measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to summarize the central tendency and spread of the data.

- **Data Visualization:** Creating informative plots and charts to visually represent the distribution of data, identify patterns, and explore relationships between variables.

- **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling anomalies or outliers that may impact the analysis or machine learning models.

- **Data Cleaning:** Addressing missing values, handling duplicates, and ensuring data quality for more reliable insights.

By conducting EDA, data analysts gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, enabling them to make informed decisions and select appropriate techniques for further analysis or modeling.
